# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis
## Project Objective
• Developed an interactive Power Bi dashboard for Electric Vehicle and Gained insights into the electric vehicle market, identifying 
the dominance of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with a market share of 60% and the growth of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles 
(PHEVs) at 30% . 
• Analysis contributed to 20% improved forecasting for incentive planning and provided actionable insights for stakeholders in 
electric vehicle adoption trends  .

## Problem Statement
KPI’S Requirement
1. Total Vehicles:
• Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. Average Electric Range:
• Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
• Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
• Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
• Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
• Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
